# Emails-Text-Classification
The aim of the project was to classify the e-mails written by people with subjects such as complaints, suggestions and thanks, and ensure that they are sent to the right units.In the past, it took a long time to send the mails to the right units. This causes delayed response to emails.In this way, customer losses decreased by 50%.
